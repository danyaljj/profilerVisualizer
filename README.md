This is a web interface for the profiler. 

- The assumptions is that the profiler data base is running on a machine on a AWS EC2 machine. 
- The user will be able to choose knowledge schema and qeuery based on that. 
- Querying is simply filling our the missing values (dependant on the type of schema).  
- The output will be results matching to the query, sorted by their score. 
- The tabular representation seems to be appropriate enough.
